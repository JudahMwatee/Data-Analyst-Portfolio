The objective of repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

# PYTHON WEBSCAPING

Objective:
Get CSV file of all the books titles, price and star rating in a website.

Description:
In this project i demonstrate how to scrape multiple web pages using BeautifulSoup and export the results to a CSV files using Pandas Library. 
i used books.toscrape.com as the web scraping playground.

## [Web Scraping code](https://github.com/JudahMwatee/Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/main/Web_Scraping_to_CSV.ipynb)

In this project i have taken data from the first 5 pages of the website.

# CREATING A DATABASE WITH PYTHON

In this project i created a database using sqlite3 library.(INSTRUCTOR.DB)
Created a table INSTRUCTOR with colunms: ID, First Name, Last Name, City and Country Code with ID as the Primary Key
